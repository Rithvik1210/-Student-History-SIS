Executive Summary
Understanding of Academic History
In a database, the term "academic history" typically refers to a section or table that stores and maintains a student's academic records and educational progress throughout their enrollment at an educational institution. It serves as a comprehensive record of a student's courses, grades, credits, degrees, and other relevant academic information.
The Academic History table in a banner database may include the following fields or attributes:
Student ID: A unique identifier for each student
Course Code: The code or identifier assigned to each course
Course Title: The title or name of the course
Term/Session: The specific academic term or session in which the course was taken.
Grade: The grade or evaluation received by the student for the course
Credit Hours: The number of credit hours assigned to the course
GPA: The grade point average is calculated based on the student's grades and credits earned.
Degree Program: The specific degree program in which the student is enrolled
Degree Earned: Indicates whether the student has completed and earned a degree.
Date of Completion: The date when the degree was awarded or completed
Academic Standing: The student's standing or status based on their academic performance (e.g., good standing, probation, suspension)
The academic history data within a banner database is vital for various administrative and academic purposes, such as advising students, generating official transcripts, evaluating degree progress, and assessing eligibility for academic honors or financial aid. It provides a comprehensive snapshot of a student's academic journey and allows institutions to track their academic achievements and progress over time.

Scope of Work
Expectation
Enhancing the existing Academic History API with new features
Academic History API Phase-1 Documentation-Dominators
Using Term Code or Level Code as Input Parameters: We would like to introduce the ability to utilize Term Code or Level Code as additional input parameters in the request body. This enhancement will provide more flexibility and precision in filtering and retrieving data from the API, aligning it more closely with your specific requirements.
Updating PL/SQL query in pascal code
Ordering Entities in the Illuminate Response Body: To improve the clarity and ease of interpretation of the API responses, we propose to reorganize the entities in the Illuminate Response Body in a logical order. By presenting the entities in a structured manner, it will enhance the user experience and facilitate better comprehension of the data retrieved from the API.(Demographic Information, Transfer GPA, Level GPA, Institutional courses, Transfer Courses)
Generating Insert scripts based on the input parameters to load academic history data into staging tables
Out of Scope
The following functionalities are out of scope for an Academic History API:
Course registration: APIs related to the process of enrolling in courses or managing class schedules are separate from an Academic History API.
Learning management systems: APIs specifically dedicated to delivering educational content, managing assignments, or facilitating online learning activities are not part of an Academic History API.
Financial transactions: Handling payment processing, such as tuition fees or course payments, is outside the scope of an Academic History API.
Academic advising: Providing personalized academic guidance or counseling services to students is beyond the scope of an Academic History API.
Alumni services: APIs or functionalities related to alumni networks, career services, or post-graduation activities are not considered part of academic history and may be separate from an Academic History API.
